# Working on `crates/native`

Read this before touching the GPUI app in `crates/native`. It lists what the
port has met so far, each with the reason.

The tags follow [`tauri-app.md`](./tauri-app.md): **Hit** broke something here,
**Measured** steered a design decision, **Inferred** comes from sources or docs
only.

Source: [the gpui-port plan](../plans/20261109-gpui-port/plan.md), its spike
and Step 1's [learnings](../plans/20261109-gpui-port/learnings.md).

## Toolchain

### GPUI comes from one pinned Zed rev (Inferred)

`gpui` and `gpui_platform` are git dependencies on Zed's repository at
`b5cd310b3b54dfc659fcc06453e6358843dfe216`; crates.io's `gpui 0.2.2` is stale.
Zed pins Rust 1.98.1, and so does `crates/native/mise.toml`.

- Rule: bump the rev only in a deliberate chore PR, and record API changes met
  at the bump here.

### Only two of Zed's patches are needed (Inferred)

`[patch.crates-io]` carries Zed's `async-task` and `async-process` forks. Zed's
other patches (`cpal`, `notify`, `calloop`, `khronos-egl`, ...) are not needed
by `gpui` / `gpui_platform`.

- Rule: do not copy the others. Do not move these two to the root workspace
  while the Tauri app lives there: both crates are in its lock, so a workspace
  patch would swap them for Zed's forks in the shipped app.

### Linux needs system libraries, macOS and Windows do not (Inferred)

Per Zed's `script/linux`: `libfontconfig-dev`, `libwayland-dev`,
`libx11-xcb-dev`, `libxkbcommon-x11-dev`, `libvulkan1`, plus a Vulkan-capable
driver at run time. macOS needs the Xcode CLT (Metal), Windows only MSVC.

### Without NASM, mozjpeg silently loses SIMD (Measured)

`mozjpeg-sys`'s build script runs `nasm -v`, prints a `cargo:warning` and
continues without SIMD when that fails, and cargo hides build-script warnings
of non-path dependencies. RAF decode measured about 99 ms without SIMD and
46 ms with it. `crates/native/build.rs` therefore fails the build, and its own
`cargo:warning` is the only place the SIMD state is visible.

### winget's NASM is per-user and not on `PATH` (Hit)

`winget install NASM.NASM` installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bin\NASM`, not
`C:\Program Files\NASM`, and adds nothing to `PATH`.

- Rule: put that directory on `PATH` for every build.

### `mozjpeg-sys` ignores the `NASM` variable (Inferred)

`nasm-rs` honors `NASM` as the binary path, but the `nasm_supported()` probe of
`mozjpeg-sys` 2.2.3 runs plain `nasm` from `PATH`. `build.rs` therefore runs
`nasm -v` from `PATH` only and fails when it does not run, whatever `NASM` holds.

- Rule: put `nasm` on `PATH`; setting `NASM` does not satisfy the build.

## GPUI

### `RenderImage` holds BGRA and must be released (Inferred)

`RenderImage` holds BGRA in an `image::RgbaImage`. Every image handed to the
renderer must be released with `cx.drop_image(image, None)` or it leaks on the
GPU.

### Textures have one mip level (Inferred)

A large downscale (a RAF fit to a 1600 px window) may alias. Not settled: one
captured 1:1 crop of a 4416x2944 RAF fit view, a clapboard wall without fine
repeating texture, shows no moire, but no comparison with the Tauri app or a
hard-case image has been made; the gpui-port plan's Step 3 makes that check.

### The image sprite cannot rotate (Inferred)

`PolychromeSprite` has no `transformation`; only the monochrome SVG sprite
does. A rotation has to happen on the pixels before painting.

### There is no after-`Present` hook (Measured)

`cx.defer` from the paint closure runs after the frame's `draw()` and
`present()`, which is the stamp the spike's timings used. It is a workaround
and may change with a GPUI bump. `crates/native` follows that pattern: the
paint closure stamps `paint_started` and `paint_finished`, then the deferred
callback stamps `presented`, prints the `page` line and releases the retired
images with `cx.drop_image`. Doing the release earlier than that deferred
callback could pull a texture out from under the frame being presented.

### Rotating on the CPU needs threads for a RAF's budget (Measured)

Windows, release, idle, 31 runs of synthetic BGRA buffers, p50 in ms, 90 degree
turns (orientation 6 / 8): 1616x1080 plain loop 3.2, 64-pixel tiles 1.6, tiles
over 8 threads 0.9; 4000x3000 plain 62, tiles 21, tiles over 8 threads 9-11;
4416x2944 plain 70, tiles 23, tiles over 8 threads 12-13. Allocating the output
alone costs about 8 ms at 4000x3000 (a plain copy of the buffer takes that long).
In the app on real portrait files: 1616x1080 ARW `orient` 1.3-1.5 ms, 1920x1280
RAF about 2.2 ms, 4000x3000 RAF (GFX 100) 7.6-8.5 ms.

- Rule: `orient.rs` tiles over 8 scoped threads because the tiled loop alone
  misses the plan's 15 ms budget on a 4000x3000 RAF; orientation 1 returns the
  buffer without a copy and 3 reverses in place.

### mozjpeg reports corrupt input by unwinding (Inferred)

`mozjpeg` 0.10's decoder calls `resume_unwind` on a libjpeg fatal error, so a
corrupt file would otherwise end the background task and leave the pager's
request in flight forever.

- Rule: wrap every decode in `catch_unwind`, as `load` does through `guarded`.

### Key names on Windows are lowercase (Measured)

`KeyDownEvent.keystroke.key` is `"right"`, `"left"`, `"home"`, `"end"` and `"q"`,
checked with injected `keybd_event` key events in the running app. A non-extended
`VK_RIGHT` / `VK_LEFT`, the keypad's, gives the same names.

### IME handling is unverified (Inferred)

It exists in `gpui_windows`; nothing has exercised it yet.

### The native folder picker is `cx.prompt_for_paths` (Measured)

It takes `PathPromptOptions`. With `directories: true` and `files: false` it
is the OS folder dialog; Enter on a typed path navigates into the folder, and a
second Enter selects it.

## Timings

### `keypressToPixels` differs from the Tauri app's (Inferred)

The `page` line uses the Tauri line's `wait` / `read` / `decode` meanings,
collapses `ipc + post + worker` into `hop` (the time from the background result
to the update on the main thread), and splits `draw` into
`frameWait + paint + present`. `keypressToPixels` includes `present`; Tauri's
stops at `drawImage`. It starts at the latest press of the file that ended up
shown.
